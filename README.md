Implementation of the Stacks 2.0 wallet for Desktop

## Getting started

1. Ensure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.
1. After [cloning the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository), run `yarn` in the root of the project to install the dependencies.
1. Run `yarn dev:testnet` to start a development server.

### Ubuntu

Ensure you're using a recent version of Node v14 and yarn 1. This project requires these versions for development.

If you're using `nvm`, you can install and use Node v14 with,

```bash
nvm install 14
nvm use 14
```

When using Node v14, `yarn` needs to be installed separately. [Follow yarn's installation instructions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable).

With Node v14 and yarn installed, run `yarn dev:testnet` to start developing.
